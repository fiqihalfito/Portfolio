Next JS is so powerful framework that I have known. it can do front-end and back-end in a single application. the most feature that I amaze is the layouting method. we can make a component that can be rendered only once and that component is not gonna rendered again even we move to another page. this method can drastically increase web page loadtime. It's in Next.JS 13 only."
